# MoCA

*Multimedia over Coax Alliance - networking over existing coax cables*

## Definition
MoCA (Multimedia over Coax Alliance) enables high-speed networking using existing coaxial TV cables. Creates ethernet-like connections without running new wires.

## Key Benefits
- **Speed**: MoCA 2.5 supports up to 2.5 Gbps
- **Reliability**: Much more stable than powerline networking
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Uses coax already in walls
- **Low Latency**: Suitable for real-time applications

## Implementation
Two MoCA adapters create a point-to-point ethernet connection over coax. One adapter connects to router ethernet, the other provides ethernet at destination.

## Success Story
Deployed MoCA adapters (2025-08-29) to connect kitchen access point, achieving 3x speed improvement after powerline adapters failed due to instability.

## Lesson
Survey existing home wiring (coax, phone lines) before assuming new cable runs are needed for network expansion.
