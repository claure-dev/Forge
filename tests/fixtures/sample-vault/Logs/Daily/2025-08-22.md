## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**01:21 AM**: It's too late and I'm still up messing with my work project. I finally got the installation media for my framework laptop setup. I will priortize my laptop and then the network migration in the morning.

**04:16 PM**: This is my first update of the day (not counting last night) and I still have not assembled my laptop. I have been focusing on my work API project all day. I think I have found a feasible way to use copilot and a combination of MCP servers to basically do my job for me. Torn between sharing and keeping to myself at work.

**10:29 PM**: I've been tinkering with my work API project on and off all day. I actually think I am onto something with this and I'm excited to build it out. I still need to assemble my laptop. Might try to do it tonight.


## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: Professional API testing automation breakthrough using Copilot + MCP servers architecture - developed feasible automation approach for QA role with growing confidence and excitement. PopOS installation media for [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] ready from last night's prep work. Full day of iterative development on professional automation approach.

**Current Blockers**: [[Framework-Laptop]] remains unassembled despite multiple acknowledgments throughout day. Professional API project consuming mental bandwidth and priority despite hardware readiness. Evening timeline creates potential opportunity for hardware focus.

**Next Priority**: [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] hardware assembly potentially tonight - installation media ready, components available, evening timeframe could support focused hardware work. Professional automation project reached excitement threshold indicating strong development momentum.

**AI Observations**: Consistent pattern of API automation work dominating daily focus with increasing enthusiasm and confidence. Multiple captures show awareness of laptop assembly need but professional project excitement maintaining priority. Evening timing suggestion indicates potential shift toward hardware tasks when professional development reaches natural pause point.
