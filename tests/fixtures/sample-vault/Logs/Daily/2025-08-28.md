**10:10 PM**: Starting to think about how to replace Claude Code in KnowledgeOS. After forcing the AI to be real with me, it's come to my attention that KnowledgeOS is a terrible name. I think we're rebranding as Forge. I am going to have claude research how to replace himself.

## Completed Today
<!-- Tasks completed today from all projects -->

## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: Major strategic breakthrough - completed comprehensive research and created [[Forge-Web-Development-Project]] proposal for local AI CLI to replace Claude Code. Established orchestration-level capability project with 5-phase implementation plan using Python, Ollama integration, and semantic search. Confirmed "Forge" rebrand with consumer-to-builder transformation philosophy. Structured vault simplification approach for better AI processing.

**Current Blockers**: [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] still blocked on upstairs [[TP-Link-EAP245]] connectivity solution after powerline adapter failure. [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] awaiting final validation. New [[Forge-Web-Development-Project]] needs activation decision and prioritization against existing projects.

**Next Priority**: Activate [[Forge-Web-Development-Project]] as next major capability development or complete existing projects first. Forge CLI represents significant infrastructure independence advancement and aligns perfectly with orchestration-level progression. Decision point: parallel development vs sequential completion.

**AI Observations**: Evening productive deep work session - moved from abstract concept to concrete project proposal with technical architecture. Research agent effectively scoped comprehensive solution. Pattern shows capability for handling complex system design and multi-phase planning. Tactical execution rhythm maintaining effectiveness for both immediate tasks and strategic advancement.
