## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**12:38 AM**: Just created the newest daily note. It's past midnight so it's technically a new day. In the morning I need focus on implementing the first access point.

**12:41 AM**: The update before this was a test of the new latest version of the /log command in knowledge OS. I guess this one kind of is too. I spend a lot of time tinkering with KOS instead of completing projects.

**01:02 AM**: testing update with the new model selection in mind

**09:15 AM**: Started workshopping the idea of an official KnowledgeOS obsidian plugin. I think there might be something in that to help people grow a personalized PKM system. I really need to deploy this network hardware.

**12:43 PM**: just made an important discovery that has implications for my network infrastructure. I traced the entry point for my internet service from the modem. The cable enters the house through the basement and goes through the unfinished portion of the basement, and then routes along the unfinished ceiling and goes up into the kitchen, where it terminates at the router. The important part is that the portion of the cable in the unfinished part of my basement is already split and reconnected to continue the run up to the kitchen. I think I can use this split point to reeroute critical infrastructure to the basement and free up the kitchen.

**02:47 PM**: I've decided to just move forward with setting up the first access point in the kitchen in a temporary location. I need to think more about how to reconfigure to use the basement as the main hub.

**07:20 PM**: I finally got the first kitchen AP all set up. Time to get the mesh access points deployed next.

**08:01 PM**: upstairs wireless mesh is operational

**08:58 PM**: All of the access points are now deployed. The upstairs and the basement access points are temporarily on mesh, and the kitchen is wired. The Modem, Router, Mini PC and AP are all sitting on the kitchen counter. I'm going to try to reconfigure so the hub is in the basement tomorrow.

**10:32 PM**: I have decided to call phase 1 of the network deployment done. I need to create a phase 2 project that will involve reloacting critical infrastructure to the basement to serve as a sort of server room. I think this makes sense anyway, to give this project room to grow. As part of this migration, I need to figure out how to best run a wire to the upstairs access point. The basement and the kitchen should be solved by PoE switch that should be arriving tomorrow. Testing with powerline adapter from kitchen to upstairs did not work - the adapters didn't have a stable connection, but I didn't have access to test every plug. Maybe after I move everything.

## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: Phase 1 of [[Network-Foundation-Project]] completed - all three [[TP-Link-EAP245]] access points deployed with full coverage! [[Omada-Controller-Service]] managing unified network replacing Google Nest system. Basement cable split discovery enabling future server room strategy. Kitchen wired backbone operational, upstairs/basement wireless mesh active.

**Current Blockers**: Infrastructure temporarily staged on kitchen counter ([[GL-iNet-Flint-2]], [[Beelink-Mini-PC]], modem). Upstairs ethernet wiring challenge - powerline adapters failed. Need proper cable routing solution from basement hub.

**Next Priority**: Create [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] project for server room migration using basement cable split point. Integrate PoE switch for power/data management when it arrives tomorrow.
