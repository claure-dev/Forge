## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**11:18 AM**: I stayed up until 3am last night, still messing around with my work project. I think I'm close to something pretty cool. I have been staying up too late. Slept in today, wife took the kids out, and I have a burst of motivation for some reason. I'm going to ride this to deep clean and rearrange my office, and then hopefully put my laptop together.

**05:32 PM**: Finished cleaning and rearranging my office. I type this from my new workspace. I also staged the basement for the hardware migration. Still need to put together that latop. Going to a game night at Chris's now. Hoping to finish laptop and hardare migration tomorrow.

## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: Complete office deep clean and workspace rearrangement finished - now typing from optimized workspace setup. Basement staging completed for [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] migration with physical preparation work done. Professional API automation project breakthrough momentum continuing from 3am development sessions.

**Current Blockers**: [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] hardware assembly still pending despite repeated mentions across multiple captures. Game night at Chris's creating evening time constraint. Hardware migration timing dependent on tomorrow's schedule and energy levels.

**Next Priority**: Tomorrow's dual hardware focus - [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] Phase 1 assembly (30-45 minutes) and [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] infrastructure migration. Both projects have physical preparation complete and await execution.

**AI Observations**: Successful completion of environmental optimization creating optimal workspace for technical tasks. Pattern of infrastructure preparation (office organization, basement staging) preceding hardware implementation suggests methodical approach to complex technical work. Social commitment (game night) demonstrates healthy work-life balance maintenance during intensive project phases.
