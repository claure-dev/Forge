## Today's Focus
<!-- Active project tasks on 2025-08-26 -->

**Active Projects**: [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] (day 6), [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] (day 7)

From [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]]:
- [ ] Configure network administration tools for personal infrastructure #framework-setup
- [ ] Install remote access tools for [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] management #framework-setup
- [ ] Configure secure credential management for infrastructure access #framework-setup

From [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]]:
- [x] Plan basement server area physical layout and power requirements #network-phase2 ✅ 2025-08-26
- [x] Research optimal cable routing path from basement to upstairs AP location #network-phase2 ✅ 2025-08-26
- [x] Configure PoE switch for AP power management (when arrives) #network-phase2 ✅ 2025-08-26

## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**03:17 PM**: refactored knowledgeOS again. Been working on my API project at work the last two days. I'm making progress on it and have copilot posting user stories and bugs for me now. I still need to migrate my hardware. I might do setup for that soon.

**03:18 PM**: The PoE switch is here, guess I never updated that. First thing I need to do is cut and cap a length of coax to splice into the existing line

**09:30 PM**: I completed the first part of my network hardware migration. The modem, router and mini pc are now located in the basement and functional. The kitchen AP is on a mesh connection for now until I run a wire to it, and the upstairs AP is still mesh. I'll have to see if the powerline adapters are more effective with the new placement.

**09:41 PM**: Trimmed down the daily note again. I keep making changes to KOS instead of just using it for a while, but something about it just feels off. I'm still not sure what it is.

**10:32 PM**: Fixed omada-controller VM to auto start properly after reboot. Added SSH keys from desktop and framework to both the omada-controller and proxmox host for passwordless SSH.


## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: MASSIVE PROGRESS - Completed [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] basement hub migration AND resolved [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] mobile infrastructure management. Fixed Omada Controller VM auto-start issue via Ubuntu auto-login and Docker restart policies. Established passwordless SSH access from both Desktop and Framework laptop to [[Beelink-Mini-PC]] Proxmox host and Ubuntu VM. Work API project advancing with AI copilot automation.

**Current Blockers**: Only Syncthing file synchronization remains for complete mobile infrastructure management capability. [[TP-Link-EAP245]] access points still on mesh connections pending powerline adapter testing. Knowledge-OS refinement trap mostly resolved - system stabilizing.

**Next Priority**: Complete [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] with Syncthing setup for Knowledge-OS file sync between machines. Then test powerline adapters from basement router location. Mobile infrastructure management nearly complete - last mile execution.

**AI Observations**: Breakthrough day - shifted from system tweaking to actual infrastructure capability building. SSH key setup and VM auto-start resolution represent real operational improvements. Framework laptop transformation from development machine to infrastructure management workstation almost complete. System building momentum accelerating with concrete technical wins.
