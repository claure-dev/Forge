**Active Projects**: [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] (day 5), [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]]

From [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]]:
- [ ] Configure network administration tools for personal infrastructure #framework-setup
- [ ] Install remote access tools for [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] management #framework-setup
- [ ] Configure secure credential management for infrastructure access #framework-setup

From [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]]:
- [ ] Plan basement server area physical layout and power requirements #network-phase2
- [ ] Research optimal cable routing path from basement to upstairs AP location #network-phase2
- [ ] Configure PoE switch for AP power management (when arrives) #network-phase2

## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**12:18 AM**: I keep tweaking KnowledgeOS. I'm not sure why but it doesn't feel quite right to me. Maybe it's tryin to do too much, or maybe I am overthinking it. I have actually gotten some projects done with it, but there might be a better way. I can't help but wonder if it's over-engineered. I want to look more into making an actual obsidian plugin with Local LLMs, but I don't know if they will be consistent enough.

## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: Completed major [[Knowledge-OS]] workflow redesign with static daily note snapshots, eliminating dynamic query issues while preserving historical accuracy and navigation value.

**Current Blockers**: System complexity concerns - [[Knowledge-OS]] may be over-engineered for actual workflow needs. Uncertainty about local LLM consistency for potential Obsidian plugin development.

**Next Priority**: Research Obsidian plugin development with local LLMs to assess feasibility versus current [[Knowledge-OS]] v2.0 system complexity.

**AI Observations**: Detecting meta-workflow evaluation pattern - questioning system architecture after successful implementation suggests perfectionist tendencies competing with practical utility. The "doesn't feel right" sensation despite proven project completion indicates potential cognitive load from system maintenance overhead versus pure execution focus.
