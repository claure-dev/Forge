**Active Projects**: [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] (started today)

From [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]]:
- [ ] Assemble Framework laptop hardware #framework-setup
- [ ] Install PopOS and configure base system #framework-setup  
- [ ] Set up development environment #framework-setup
- [ ] Configure mobile network administration tools #framework-setup

## Completed Today

## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**01:33 AM**: it's way too late and I'm just tinkering with knowledgeOS some more. I think it's key that the system intelligently tracks my actual network infrastructure and hardware status as living documentation that grows as I complete projects. I did actually get some stuff done while using it, so maybe there's something to it. I do want to want to continue investigating KnowledgeOS as an actual obsidian plugin.

**12:29 PM**: I decided to do some actual work today for my real job. Maybe it's time to consider how we track that in KOS. I'm attempting again to create an automated test suite for the API that leverages generated typescript clients and a lightweight wrapper layer to enable the copilot assistant to interact with the API intelligently and help do my job as QA for the API team. Also, my framework laptop finally arrived and I need to set it up. I want to to make that a priority.

**04:05 PM**: Even though my laptop is here and I need to assemble and configure it, I have spent all day iterating on KnowledgeOS while also iterating on my work API project. I am interacting with AI on multiple screens for different purposes. It almost feels like too much.

## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: Extensive [[@Knowledge-OS]] v2.0 development session completing template refactoring and streamlined tactical/strategic architecture. [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] now active with hardware ready for assembly. Professional API testing automation architecture development using TypeScript clients and AI wrapper approach. Multi-screen AI interaction workflow established for parallel work streams.

**Current Blockers**: [[Framework-Laptop]] ready for assembly but spending day on [[@Knowledge-OS]] development and professional API work instead. Multiple active work streams but no hard blockers.

**Next Priority**: [[Framework-Laptop]] assembly remains the concrete next action - hardware is physically present and project activated.

**AI Observations**: User experiencing "lost in the AI sauce" feeling from multi-screen AI interactions across different projects. Not necessarily problematic - more observation about current work pattern immersion in AI-assisted workflows.
