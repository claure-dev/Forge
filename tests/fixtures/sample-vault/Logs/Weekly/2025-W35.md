# Weekly Log — Week of 2025-08-31
*(covering 2025-08-25 → 2025-08-31)*

## Highlights (AI)
- Successfully deployed MoCA adapters for kitchen AP ethernet backhaul, achieving 3x speed improvement and eliminating mesh instability
- Made critical decision to radically simplify vault structure from 27 directories to 7, reducing cognitive overhead and maintenance burden
- Completed Forge Web App Phase 1 with working localhost prototype using FastAPI and Ollama integration
- Established reliable basement infrastructure hub with relocated router and Mini PC, setting foundation for full ethernet backhaul
- Your energy came from the tangible network improvements and desire to build something real - the infrastructure work is satisfying when it delivers measurable results

## Decisions (auto-pulled)
- **2025-08-28**: Rebrand from Knowledge-OS to Forge, commit to personal-first development over community features
- **2025-08-29**: Choose web GUI architecture for Forge over CLI approach for better daily usability
- **2025-08-29**: Deploy MoCA adapters for network backhaul instead of unstable powerline adapters
- **2025-08-31**: Move from complex nested structure to flat 7-directory structure for reduced overhead

## Lessons (auto-pulled)
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Always test connectivity solutions thoroughly before production deployment (basement hub success)
- **Powerline Limitations**: Powerline adapters inadequate for reliable network infrastructure despite marketing claims
- **MoCA Success**: Existing coax infrastructure can be effectively repurposed for ethernet backhaul (3x speed improvement)
- **System Complexity**: Over-engineering creates maintenance overhead that competes with actual work
- **Personal-First Development**: Building for personal workflow eliminates feature complexity and accelerates progress
- **Work-Life Balance**: Physical activity (disc golf) provides cognitive reset for sustained technical productivity

## Active Projects (AI summary)
- **[[Forge Web App]]**: Phase 1 complete with working prototype, Phase 2 (vault integration) ready to begin. Your uncertainty about whether it's worth pursuing reflects the tension between building vs. relying on cloud LLMs
- **[[Network Phase 2 Basement]]**: Kitchen AP converted to ethernet via MoCA (major win!), basement hub established. Next: run cable to upstairs AP for full ethernet backhaul
- **[[Media Server]]**: Planning stage - you mentioned it's time to start thinking about implementation on home network
- **[[Local AI Integration]]**: Experimentation phase - desire to reduce Claude Code reliance but concerns about local LLM effectiveness vs. frontier models
- **[[Linux Administration]]**: Ongoing capability building through infrastructure work
- **[[Kids Workstation]]**: Research completed, awaiting execution

## Reflections (Your input)
- **What gave you energy this week?**
	- The desire to add wired connections to my access points and relocate them for optimal coverage. 
- **What drained you?**
	- Thinking about how I should approach the Forge web app, or if it's worth pursuing at all.
- **What surprised you?**
	- Switching the Kitchen AP to wired backhaul with MOCA adapters resulted in a much bigger upgrade to download and upload speed than I was expecting, especially for wireless devices upstairs being served by upstairs AP, which is still mesh.
- **What did you learn about yourself or your tools?**
	- I think I learned that I want to build something, and it's manifesting in the form of the Forge web app. I kind of like the workflow and how it's been going using Claude Code, but the reliance on cloud hosted LLMs rubs me the wrong way. That said, I worry about how effective local LLMs will be in replacing a frontier cloud model.
- **What do you want to change next week?**
	- I want to continue experimenting with local LLMs. I want to reduce reliance on Claude Code for my vault project. I want to wire the upstairs AP but I need to come up with a plan to do that. I think it's time to start thinking about how to implement the media server on my home network. 

## Next Week (plan with AI help)
- [ ] Continue local LLM experimentation - test specific Forge workflows with Ollama models
- [ ] Plan ethernet cable run to upstairs AP (research routing options through walls/ceiling)
- [ ] Begin Phase 2 of Forge Web App - implement File System Access API for vault integration
- [ ] Research media server implementation options (Jellyfin/Plex on Proxmox vs. dedicated hardware)
- [ ] Document MoCA adapter setup and performance gains for future reference
