- **Custom domain support** (up to 3 domains) - Professional email identity
- **Shared vault functionality** - Collaborative credential management
- **NetShield DNS filtering** - Network-level ad/malware blocking
- **Proton Sentinel protection** - Advanced threat monitoring

**Value Proposition:**
- $14.99/month with annual commitment (permanent discount)
- Two-user allocation with independent privacy boundaries
- Administrator control over storage allocation
- Shared infrastructure credentials via Pass vaults

### Network-Level VPN Implementation

**GL.iNet Flint 2 Compatibility:**
- **Fully supported** for both OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols
- **WireGuard recommended** - Up to 900 Mbps vs 190 Mbps OpenVPN
- **Simple drag-and-drop** configuration file installation
- **Built-in VPN client** support in GL.iNet admin interface

**Implementation Options:**

**Option 1: WireGuard (Recommended)**
```
Performance: Up to 900 Mbps throughput
Setup: Download config from Proton → VPN → WireGuard Client → Upload
Benefits: Better speed, modern protocol, lower latency
```

**Option 2: OpenVPN (Fallback)**
```
Performance: Up to 190 Mbps throughput
Setup: Download config from Proton → VPN → OpenVPN Client → Upload
Benefits: Wider compatibility, proven stability
```

**Network Architecture Considerations:**
- **All devices protected** - Router-level implementation covers entire network
- **DNS leak prevention** - Automatic configuration to Proton DNS (10.2.0.1)

- **Shared vaults** - Collaborative access to network infrastructure credentials
- **Cross-platform access** - Web, desktop, mobile apps
- **Limitation** - No dedicated secrets management API/CLI (enterprise feature request)

**Backup Infrastructure (Proton Drive):**
- **Encrypted sync** - Cross-platform file synchronization
- **Photo backup** - Automatic mobile photo protection
- **Real-time sync** - Latest versions across all devices
- **Swiss hosting** - Data sovereignty and privacy laws
- **Integration challenge** - Limited third-party API for automation
- **Storage optimization** - Local/cloud hybrid storage management

**Email Infrastructure (Proton Mail):**
- **Custom domain support** - Professional identity for knowledge infrastructure
- **Encrypted communication** - End-to-end encryption for sensitive coordination
- **Calendar integration** - Project planning and maintenance scheduling
- **Alias management** - Service-specific email addresses for account isolation

### Privacy Infrastructure Architecture

**Network Layer:**
```
Internet → Proton VPN (Router) → Internal Network
         ↓
    NetShield DNS Filtering
    Malware/Ad Blocking
    IP Masking
```

**Application Layer:**
```
Proton Mail → Secure communication
Proton Pass → Credential management
Proton Drive → Encrypted backup/sync
Proton Calendar → Project coordination
```

**Integration Benefits:**
- **Single ecosystem** - Unified privacy approach across all services
- **Shared authentication** - Single sign-on across Proton services
- **Consistent encryption** - End-to-end protection throughout stack
- **Swiss jurisdiction** - Strong privacy law protection

## Implementation Recommendations

**Start with Network-Level VPN Implementation:** This provides immediate privacy benefits for all devices and establishes the foundation for advanced privacy infrastructure.

**Prioritize WireGuard over OpenVPN:** The 4-5x performance improvement on Flint 2 makes this the clear choice for always-on network VPN.

**Implement gradual service integration:** Rather than configuring all services simultaneously, focus on one service per week to ensure proper testing and documentation.

**Document everything:** Privacy infrastructure requires comprehensive documentation for troubleshooting and knowledge transfer.

**Plan for maintenance:** Monthly optimization and quarterly security reviews ensure continued effectiveness and performance.

The Proton services ecosystem provides a comprehensive foundation for privacy-first computing that aligns perfectly with knowledge infrastructure goals. The combination of network-level VPN protection, encrypted communication, secure credential management, and private backup creates a robust foundation for advanced AI orchestration and local-first computing initiatives.
