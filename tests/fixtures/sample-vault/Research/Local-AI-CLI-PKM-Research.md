# Local AI CLI PKM Research

*Comprehensive research into building a local AI-powered CLI for personal knowledge management to replace Claude Code functionality*

## Research Scope

Investigation of technical requirements, architecture patterns, and implementation approaches for developing a local AI CLI tool that provides intelligent personal knowledge management capabilities without relying on cloud services. Focus areas include Ollama integration, vector databases, file monitoring, markdown processing, and existing tool analysis.

## Key Findings

- **Rust**: Community-maintained integration with memory safety benefits and high-performance characteristics

**Integration Architecture**:
- REST API endpoints: `/api/generate` and `/api/chat` for inference
- Streaming responses via `stream=True` parameter
- Async operations through AsyncClient
- Error handling with ResponseError exceptions and automatic model pulling on 404 errors
- Context management for conversation continuity

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Lightweight AI model serving platform optimized for local deployment
- Docker support for containerized deployment
- gRPC interface available for faster production-tier searches
- Memory-efficient processing suitable for local development environments
