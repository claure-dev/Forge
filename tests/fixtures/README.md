- `Quick-References/` - Cheat sheets and quick lookups

**Usage:**
- **Development testing** - Use for testing Forge features without affecting real vaults
- **Demo content** - Examples of AI-enhanced knowledge management patterns
- **Automated testing** - CI/CD can index and query this vault to verify functionality
- **Documentation** - Shows intended usage patterns for new users

This vault structure reflects real-world knowledge management needs and serves as both a testing ground and example of Forge Desktop's capabilities.
