## Goal
Develop Linux system administration skills to support growing home infrastructure and reduce dependence on GUI tools.

## Steps
- [x] Configure [[SSH]] key infrastructure for passwordless access
- [x] Setup mobile administration via [[Framework Laptop]]
- [x] Learn basic [[Proxmox]] management via CLI
- [x] Practice container service debugging with [[Docker]]
- [ ] Master network troubleshooting commands
- [ ] Learn system monitoring and log analysis
- [ ] Develop backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Practice user and permission management

## Decisions
- 2025-08-26 — Established SSH key infrastructure for Framework laptop to all systems for mobile administration
- 2025-08-18 — Use Proxmox and Docker environments as learning platforms rather than separate lab
