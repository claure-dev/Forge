# Local AI Integration

## Goal
Integrate local AI capabilities throughout home infrastructure for privacy-first AI assistance without cloud dependencies.

## Steps
- [x] Install Ollama on [[Desktop]] with RTX 3080 acceleration
- [x] Configure multiple AI models (llama3.1, codellama, etc.)
- [x] Develop [[Forge Web App]] with local AI integration
- [x] Create localhost AI chat interface
- [ ] Integrate AI with knowledge vault file operations
- [ ] Deploy network-accessible AI services
- [ ] Configure AI assistance for infrastructure tasks

## Decisions
- 2025-08-28 — Use Desktop PC with RTX 3080 as primary AI host for model acceleration
- 2025-08-30 — Integrate AI via web interface rather than CLI for better daily usage
