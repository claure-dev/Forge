**Performance vs Alternatives:**
- vLLM performs up to 3.23x faster than Ollama with high concurrent requests
- Ollama caps at ~22 requests/second with 32+ concurrent users
- Ollama prioritizes ease of use over raw performance

### Installation and Setup Process

**Cross-Platform Installation:**

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
sudo systemctl enable ollama  # Auto-start on boot
```

**Windows:**
- Download installer from ollama.ai
- Run executable for automatic installation
- Configure environment variables through System Properties

**macOS:**
- Download .zip from ollama.ai, extract to Applications
- Alternative: `brew install ollama`

**Initial Setup:**
```bash
ollama serve                    # Start Ollama service
ollama run llama2:7b           # Download and test first model
ollama pull mistral            # Pull additional models
ollama list                    # View installed models
```

**Docker Alternative:**
```bash
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

### Best Practices and Optimization

**GPU Optimization:**
- Set `OLLAMA_GPU_LAYERS` starting with 20, adjust based on VRAM
- Configure `OLLAMA_GPU_OVERHEAD=1GB` (2GB for RTX cards with 8GB+ VRAM)
- Enable `OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1` for memory efficiency

**Memory Management:**
- Use `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE="q8_0"` for KV-cache quantization
- Set `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` using formula: Total RAM รท Model Size ร 0.8
- Set `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=2` to limit concurrent models

**Model Selection Strategy:**
- Start with 7B parameter models for most tasks
- Use quantized versions (q4_K_M) for 40% memory reduction
- Only move to 13B+ if quality improvement justifies resource cost
- Consider specialized models (DeepSeek-Coder) over general-purpose for specific tasks

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Monitor GPU usage: `nvidia-smi -l 1`
- Track memory usage and adjust layers accordingly
- Use hybrid CPU/GPU inference for large models on limited VRAM
