# GL.iNet Flint 2 Setup Research

*Comprehensive analysis of GL.iNet Flint 2 router setup process and firmware options*

## Research Scope

Investigation into GL.iNet Flint 2 (GL-MT6000) router setup process, focusing on firmware options, preparation steps, and tools needed for optimal deployment.

## Key Findings

### 1. Firmware Pre-Installation Status

**GL.iNet Custom Firmware Comes Pre-Installed**
- Ships with GL.iNet custom firmware based on OpenWrt
- No firmware flashing required for basic operation
- Custom firmware includes proprietary GL.iNet interface and features
- Built on OpenWrt foundation with additional GL.iNet tools

**Current Firmware Situation (2024-2025)**
- Recent firmware versions include GL 4.7.0 (December 2024)
- Some complexity with OpenWrt version progression:
  - GL.iNet downgraded from OpenWrt 23.05 to 21.02 for stability
  - OpenWrt 23.05 firmware (v4.23.x) available in specific streams
  - Latest versions show improvements in performance and features

### 2. Firmware Download Requirements

**For Stock GL.iNet Experience**
- No immediate firmware download required
- Router comes ready to use out of box
- **Strongly recommended**: Update firmware during initial setup
- Latest firmware available at GL.iNet download center (https://dl.gl-inet.com/)

**Current Firmware Versions Available**:
- GL 4.7.0 (Latest, December 2024)
- GL 4.6.8 (October 2024)
- GL 4.5.7 (Enhanced Wi-Fi stability)

### 3. Desktop Preparation Steps

**Pre-Setup Preparation Checklist**:

**Browser Preparation**:
- Ensure any web browser available (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- No special software downloads required
- Admin panel accessible via http://192.168.8.1

**Network Planning**:
- Identify desired network configuration
- Plan IP address scheme if different from 192.168.8.x
- Document any VLAN requirements
- Prepare VPN configuration files if using OpenVPN/WireGuard

**Documentation Gathering**:
- ISP connection details (PPPoE credentials if needed)
- Wi-Fi network names and passwords you want to set
- Any existing network devices that need integration

**Optional Firmware Research**:
- If considering vanilla OpenWrt: Download from https://openwrt.org/toh/gl.inet/gl-mt6000
- Review GL.iNet vs OpenWrt differences before deciding

### 4. GL.iNet Tools and Software

**No Special Software Downloads Required**:
- Admin panel is web-based (accessible via browser at 192.168.8.1)
- Optional: GL.iNet mobile app for smartphone-based setup
- All configuration done through web interface or mobile app

**Admin Panel Features**:
- Language selection during initial setup
- Password configuration for admin access
- Firmware update capability built-in
- Access to both GL.iNet GUI and OpenWrt Luci interface

### 5. GL.iNet Firmware vs Pure OpenWrt

**GL.iNet Custom Firmware Advantages**:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Polished, intuitive GUI
- **High VPN Performance**: WireGuard up to 900Mbps, OpenVPN up to 190Mbps
- **Multi-WAN Support**: Automatic failover between cellular, tethering, Wi-Fi, ethernet
- **Built-in Features**: Parental controls, Bark integration
- **Dual Interface Access**: GL.iNet GUI plus OpenWrt Luci interface
- **Official Support**: GL.iNet provides support and regular updates

**Pure OpenWrt Advantages**:
- **Full Configuration Control**: Access to all OpenWrt settings
- **Latest OpenWrt Features**: Direct access to newest OpenWrt capabilities
- **Community Support**: Large OpenWrt community
- **No Proprietary Limitations**: Complete open-source experience

**GL.iNet Firmware Limitations**:
- Not all settings visible in GL.iNet GUI
- May run older OpenWrt base (21.02) for stability
- Some configuration requires Luci interface access

**Installation Process for Pure OpenWrt**:
- Simple: Download sysupgrade.bin from OpenWrt website
- Connect via wired ethernet connection
- Flash using router's upgrade interface
- Described as "easy and safe" process

## Potential Atomic Projects

Based on this research, the following 1-2 week projects become feasible:

1. **Basic GL.iNet Flint 2 Network Foundation**: Initial router setup with stock firmware, basic VLAN configuration, VPN setup
2. **OpenWrt Migration Project**: Research-backed migration from GL.iNet firmware to pure OpenWrt with feature comparison
3. **Advanced Network Segmentation**: IoT VLAN setup, guest network isolation, network monitoring implementation
4. **VPN Performance Optimization**: WireGuard server setup, performance tuning, multi-site connectivity

## Prerequisites

**Hardware Requirements**:
- GL.iNet Flint 2 router
- Computer with ethernet connection capability
- Internet connection for firmware updates

**Knowledge Dependencies**:
- Basic networking concepts (IP addresses, DHCP, DNS)
- Understanding of VLAN concepts if advanced segmentation planned
- VPN basics if implementing remote access

## Integration Strategy

**Network Foundation Priority**: This router serves as foundation for all other network-dependent projects (media server, home automation, AI hosting)

**Capability Progression**: Start with stock firmware for immediate functionality, evaluate pure OpenWrt based on specific advanced needs

**Infrastructure Impact**: High-performance router enables advanced networking projects including containerized services, network monitoring, and multi-site connectivity

## Cost/Benefit Analysis

**Resource Requirements**:
- Time: 4-8 hours initial setup and configuration
- Learning: Moderate networking knowledge required
- Hardware: Router cost (~$200), no additional tools needed

**Strategic Value**:
- Unlocks all network-dependent infrastructure projects
- Provides high-performance VPN capabilities for remote work
- Enables advanced network segmentation for security
- Foundation for local-first computing infrastructure
