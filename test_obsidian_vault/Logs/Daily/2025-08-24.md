## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**12:51 AM**: Got my laptop put together but I'm going to put off the dev environment until tomorrow. Time to go to bed.

**12:27 PM**: Started getting dev env setup on my laptop but I have to go now. Will continue with troubleshooting nodejs when I get back

**09:47 PM**: Got the dev environment setup on my laptop earlier today. Have been messing around with it a bit and I'm pretty happy with the build quality and performance. Now I need to figure out how it fits into the bigger picture of my home network.

## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] Phase 3 development environment successfully completed - Node.js blocker resolved and development toolchain fully operational. [[Framework-Laptop]] now providing satisfying build quality and performance for testing workflows, meeting Phase 2 success criteria with hardware validation completed.

**Current Blockers**: Network integration planning needed for [[Framework-Laptop]] within existing infrastructure architecture. Strategic questions around mobile workstation role relative to [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] migration and remote access patterns requiring definition.

**Next Priority**: Define [[Framework-Laptop]] network integration strategy - determine remote access requirements for [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] management, configure secure credential access for infrastructure administration, and establish mobile network troubleshooting capabilities.

**AI Observations**: Major project milestone achieved with development environment completion, demonstrating effective troubleshooting persistence. Strategic thinking shift from technical setup to infrastructure integration suggests readiness for Phase 4 validation and network administration capabilities. Evening session timing optimal for planning infrastructure integration without immediate execution pressure.
