## Active Projects
<!-- Projects with status: active on 2025-08-27 -->

**Active Projects**: [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] (day 7), [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] (day 8)

## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**10:21 AM**: Working on a production release this morning at work. It is pretty disorganinzed and no one really knows what is supposed to go out or be held back. It's partially my fault for not focusing enough on the release, because I was distracted by my AI MCP project, but it's not just me. Need to discuss with the team how to be better.

**07:25 PM**: Powerline adapters are not going to work. The connection is too unstable. I will need to find another solution.

## Completed Today

## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: [[Framework-Laptop-Setup-Project]] completed - Syncthing setup finished last night, full mobile infrastructure management capability achieved. At work: handled production release despite organizational challenges. Evening testing revealed powerline adapters unsuitable for [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] - connection too unstable for reliable AP backhaul.

**Current Blockers**: Powerline adapter solution failed - need alternative approach for upstairs [[TP-Link-EAP245]] ethernet backhaul. Work production release chaos resolved but process improvement discussion still needed. Network project blocked on connectivity solution.

**Next Priority**: Research alternative solutions for upstairs AP connectivity - consider MoCA adapters over coax, direct ethernet cable run through walls, or accept mesh operation temporarily. [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] requires new strategy for completion.

**AI Observations**: Infrastructure testing revealing practical limitations - powerline networking insufficient for production use. Pattern of thorough testing before committing to solutions proving valuable. Network project adaptability required when planned solutions fail. Despite setback, methodical approach to infrastructure building continues with systematic evaluation of alternatives.
