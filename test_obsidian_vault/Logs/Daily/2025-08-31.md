## Active Projects
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link as "Project",
  capability-level as "Level",
  choice(started, "Day " + (date("2025-08-31") - date(started)).days + 1, "Not started") as "Progress"
FROM "02-Projects"
WHERE started <= date("2025-08-31") 
  AND (completed = null OR completed = "" OR completed >= date("2025-08-31"))
SORT capability-level ASC, started ASC
```

## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**05:31 PM**: Played some disc golf today. Went even par but had some good tosses. My backhand is finally starting to get good and my forehand still felt good.

## Completed Today
<!-- Tasks completed today from all projects -->
```dataview
TASK
FROM "02-Projects" OR "99-Archive"
WHERE completed AND contains(text, "✅ 2025-08-31")
GROUP BY file.link
```


## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: Enjoyed recreational disc golf session with even par performance. Notable skill progression in backhand technique showing consistent improvement from practice. Forehand maintaining good form and control. Physical activity and outdoor time providing good balance to recent intensive technical work on [[Forge-Web-Development-Project]] and [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]].

**Current Blockers**: No technical blockers today. Sunday providing natural break from project work for physical activity and recreation.

**Next Priority**: Consider evening `/weekly` reflection to synthesize this week's major accomplishments (Forge web app Phase 1 prototype, MoCA network solution deployment) and plan next week's focus areas. Both network infrastructure Phase 2 and Forge web development Phase 2 are positioned for advancement.

**AI Observations**: Healthy work-life balance pattern emerging with Sunday recreation providing cognitive reset after intense technical week. Physical skill development (disc golf technique) paralleling technical skill progression in infrastructure and AI orchestration. Natural rhythm of intense project work followed by restorative activities supports sustained productivity.
