## Active Projects
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link as "Project",
  capability-level as "Level",
  choice(started, "Day " + (date("2025-08-29") - date(started)).days + 1, "Not started") as "Progress"
FROM "02-Projects"
WHERE started <= date("2025-08-29") 
  AND (completed = null OR completed = "" OR completed >= date("2025-08-29"))
SORT capability-level ASC, started ASC
```

## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**05:33 PM**: I bought a set of MOCA adapters and used the existing coax run from the basement to the kitchen to wire up the kitchen AP. It is working nicely, and my download speed from speedtest.net has gone up over 3x on my desktop. Now I just need to figure out how to run a wire upstairs. Getting closer.

**10:45 PM**: I want to talk some more about the forge idea. I'm starting to think if I'm really just making it for me, I'd rather have a simple web gui. This could include a model selector and some other QOL features. What do you think? What sort of implications does that have for the project?

## Completed Today
<!-- Tasks completed today from all projects -->
```dataview
TASK
FROM "02-Projects" OR "99-Archive"
WHERE completed AND contains(text, "✅ 2025-08-29")
GROUP BY file.link
```


## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: Major [[Network-Infrastructure-Phase-2-Basement-Hub]] breakthrough - deployed [[MoCA-Adapters]] solution using existing coax infrastructure. Kitchen [[TP-Link-EAP245]] successfully converted to ethernet backhaul achieving 3x speed improvement on [[Desktop-PC]]. Abandoned powerline adapter approach after stability testing. Created comprehensive MoCA adapter documentation and updated project tracking.

**Current Blockers**: Upstairs [[TP-Link-EAP245]] still operating on wireless mesh - need ethernet cable routing solution from basement. [[Forge-Web-Development-Project]] undergoing major architectural pivot - CLI vs web GUI decision point with significant implementation implications.

**Next Priority**: Resolve Forge architectural direction (web GUI vs CLI) based on personal use priorities and implementation complexity. Complete network project upstairs connectivity. Strategic decision affects entire orchestration-level capability development approach.

**AI Observations**: Evening strategic thinking session revealing preference shift from CLI to web GUI for Forge project. Pattern shows user-first design thinking - prioritizing personal workflow over technical complexity. Web GUI approach offers model selection, better QOL features, potentially simpler daily usage despite more complex deployment. Architectural pivot requires fundamental project replanning but could result in more sustainable long-term solution.
