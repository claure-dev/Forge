## Today's Focus
<!-- Active project tasks on 2025-08-19 -->

**Active Projects**: [[Network-Foundation-Project]] (day 2)

From [[Network-Foundation-Project]]:
- [ ] Configure router basic settings #network-foundation
- [ ] Set up VLANs for network segmentation #network-foundation  
- [ ] Install and configure Proxmox on Mini PC #network-foundation
- [ ] Deploy Omada Controller for AP management #network-foundation

## Capture
<!-- Raw input with timestamps via /log command -->
<!-- Format: **HH:MM AM/PM**: Natural language input -->

**9:00 AM**: I created the daily note for today. My plan for this morning is to start implementing my new network hardware.

**11:13 AM**: Despite my plan to implement [[Network-Foundation-Project]], I spent all morning tinkering with KnowledgeOS. We're calling the current version v1.1. Maybe I should try to actually implement a project now.

**11:55 AM**: Testing the update command with a new session

**1:30 PM**: Continued tinkering with KnowledgeOS. Added proton documentation and integration notes and updated [[Network-Foundation-Project]] accordingly. No more excuses to not start implementing the router.

**4:20 PM**: Got the Mini PC mostly up and running, need to take a break now. Will continue when I'm back. Hope I don't get in trouble for the setup on the kitchen counter.

**10:47 PM**: Mini PC is setup, Omada Controller VM is configured with docker running. I think I'm ready to implement the access points

**11:47 PM**: testing the enhanced updated functionality



## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: Major infrastructure milestone - complete VM stack deployment achieved! [[Beelink-Mini-PC]] with Proxmox operational, [[Omada-Controller-Service]] created and running, Docker container deployed. [[Network-Foundation-Project]] now 85% complete with router configured, virtualization platform deployed, network management software operational.

**Current Blockers**: Access point deployment pending - final major component for network completion. Kitchen counter workspace temporary but functional for complex technical work.

**Next Priority**: Configure [[TP-Link-EAP245]] units through Omada Controller web interface. Establish proper VLAN segmentation and verify complete network infrastructure operational to replace Google Nest mesh.
