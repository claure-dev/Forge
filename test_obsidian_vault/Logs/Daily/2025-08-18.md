## Today's Focus
<!-- Historical note - see Capture and Tactical Context for this day's activity -->

## Capture

**Morning**: It took most of the day but v1 of [[@Knowledge-OS]] is finalized(ish). I'm going to begin testing the workflow and see if it actually works. This is my first usage of /capture since making some updates. While Claude was working, I read a quote in [[The-Demon-Haunted-World]] that stood out to me: "I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time - when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technilogical powers are in the hands of the very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness." This feels oddly prophetic, and relevant of why I'm starting this project in the first place.

**Evening**: I decided to reframe from the digital sovereignty concept to embrace the Knowledge OS (KOS) framing. It's worth noting that the concept is still important, and one of the motivating factors behind this initiative.

**Evening Session**: Completed comprehensive system audit and kids workstation research today. The multi-agent analysis revealed that Knowledge-OS sustainability concerns were overblown - with my atomic project model (2-3 active max), the scaling issues don't apply. System is much more robust than initially assessed. Major accomplishment: [[Kids-Linux-Workstation-Research]] fully documented. Research covered everything from hardware (Intel NUC 12 Pro sweet spot at $400-600) to software (Edubuntu recommended) to security (CTparental for controls). Total cost for 2-workstation setup: $1300-1700. Key insight: keep current [[Beelink-Mini-PC]] for media server - it's already perfectly spec'd with 32GB RAM for transcoding and future AI hosting. Strategic clarity achieved: hardware inventory is optimized, [[Network-Foundation-Project]] is next logical step, and research foundation exists for future projects. The workflow testing has been successful - /log command works exactly as designed. Just finished chapter 2 of [[The-Demon-Haunted-World]]. The chapter on science as a candle in the dark really reinforces why this infrastructure work matters - building the capability to think critically and maintain intellectual independence in an age of increasing technological complexity.

**11:56 PM**: This is my last update for the day. I'm mostly just testing the /log flow.


## Tactical Context
<!-- AI maintains tactical context for session continuity throughout the day -->

**Today's Accomplishments**: Completed 7 major system improvement tasks including comprehensive vault audit, @Projects MOC creation, metadata standardization, VLAN documentation, and cross-reference fixes. Knowledge-OS system reliability dramatically enhanced. Completed [[Kids-Linux-Workstation-Research]] with full hardware/software analysis (Intel NUC 12 Pro recommended). Strategic reframing from "digital sovereignty" to "Knowledge OS" positioning implemented across documentation.

**Current Blockers**: System building phase complete, ready for practical implementation. [[Network-Foundation-Project]] hardware staged and ready for deployment.

**Next Priority**: Begin [[Network-Foundation-Project]] execution with router configuration. Time to translate knowledge into working infrastructure with first practical deployment of Knowledge OS methodology.
