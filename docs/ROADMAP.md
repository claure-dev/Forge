# Forge Desktop Roadmap

## Vision Statement

**Forge Desktop will be the first truly AI-native knowledge management system** - where artificial intelligence isn't an add-on feature, but the core organizing principle that helps users capture, connect, and develop their ideas.

## Product Philosophy

### AI-First, Not AI-Added
- Traditional note apps: Notes + AI features
- **Forge**: AI-enhanced thinking with notes as the medium

### Progressive Complexity
- **Beginners**: Start with simple AI-assisted note-taking
- **Advanced users**: Leverage sophisticated knowledge graphs and AI workflows
- **Power users**: Customize AI behaviors and build complex knowledge systems

### Local-First Privacy
- All AI processing happens locally (Ollama)
- Your knowledge stays on your device
- No data harvesting or cloud dependencies

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Electron + React)
```
packages/desktop/
├── main/                  # Electron main process
│   ├── main.ts           # App initialization
│   ├── ai-server.ts      # Python server management  
│   └── file-system.ts    # File operations
├── renderer/             # React UI
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── views/           # Main application views
│   ├── hooks/           # React hooks for AI/file operations
│   └── utils/           # Utility functions
└── shared/              # Shared types and constants
```

### Backend (Python FastAPI)
```
packages/ai-server/
├── main.py              # FastAPI server (existing)
├── rag_service.py       # RAG implementation (existing)
├── wiki_links.py        # Wiki-link processing (new)
├── knowledge_graph.py   # Graph analysis (new)
└── ai_workflows.py      # Custom AI commands (new)
```

### Key Technical Decisions

**Editor Choice: Monaco (VS Code)**
- Proven performance with large files  
- Built-in syntax highlighting
- Extensible for custom features
- Familiar UX for developers

**State Management: React Context + Zustand**
- React Context for UI state
- Zustand for application state  
- Direct communication with Python server

**AI Integration Pattern**
- Electron main process manages Python server lifecycle
- Renderer communicates via IPC to main process
- Main process proxies requests to Python server
- Real-time updates via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Electron Performance**: Mitigate with efficient React patterns and worker processes
- **Python Server Stability**: Implement robust error handling and automatic restart
- **Cross-Platform Issues**: Early testing on all platforms, CI/CD for each OS

### Product Risks  
- **AI Quality**: Continuous testing with real knowledge bases, user feedback loops
- **User Adoption**: Focus on migration tools and onboarding experience
- **Feature Creep**: Maintain clear MVP scope, resist non-essential features

### Market Risks
