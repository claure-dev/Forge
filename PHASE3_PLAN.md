## Feature 1: Live File Synchronization 🔄

### Problem Statement
Currently users must manually rebuild the index when vault files change, breaking the "companion app" workflow.

### Solution Design
**File Watching System:**
- Monitor vault directory for file changes using `watchdog`
- Detect create/modify/delete events for supported file types
- Auto-update ChromaDB vector store in real-time
- Maintain index consistency without user intervention

### Technical Implementation

**New Component: `vault_watcher.py`**
```python
class VaultWatcher:
    def __init__(self, vault_path: str, rag_service: ForgeRAG):
        self.vault_path = vault_path
        self.rag_service = rag_service
        self.observer = Observer()
    
    def start_watching(self):
        # Set up watchdog observer
        # Handle file events: created, modified, deleted
        # Update vector store incrementally
    
    def handle_file_change(self, event):
        # Process individual file changes
        # Update or remove from ChromaDB
        # Log sync operations
```

**Integration Points:**
- Extend `main.py` to start/stop file watcher
- Add `/vault-sync-status` endpoint for monitoring
- Background thread for non-blocking sync operations

**Configuration:**
```python
# Debouncing to handle rapid file changes
SYNC_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS = 2

# File type filters
WATCHED_EXTENSIONS = {'.md', '.txt', '.json'}

# Ignore patterns
IGNORE_PATTERNS = {'.obsidian/*', '.git/*', '*~', '.DS_Store'}
```

### User Experience
- **Automatic**: No manual intervention required
- **Status Indicators**: Web UI shows sync status and last update
- **Performance**: Incremental updates faster than full rebuild
- **Reliability**: Handles Obsidian file locks and temporary files

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Files changes reflected in search within 5 seconds
- ✅ No manual index rebuilding required
- ✅ Handles 100+ file changes without performance degradation
- ✅ Proper handling of Obsidian metadata and temporary files

## Feature 2: Direct Vault Integration 📁

### Problem Statement
Currently requires copying files to `test_obsidian_vault` instead of working with user's actual vault.

### Solution Design
**Native Vault Support:**
- Point directly to user's Obsidian vault directory
- Handle Obsidian-specific metadata (`.obsidian` folder)
- Respect vault configuration and ignore patterns
- Support multiple vault profiles

### Technical Implementation

**Vault Configuration:**
```python
class VaultConfig:
    def __init__(self, vault_path: str, name: str = "Default"):
        self.vault_path = vault_path
        self.name = name
        self.ignore_patterns = self._load_obsidian_ignore()
        self.vault_settings = self._load_obsidian_settings()
    
    def _load_obsidian_ignore(self):
        # Read .obsidian/app.json for excluded folders
        # Add standard ignore patterns
        pass
    
    def is_file_excluded(self, file_path: str) -> bool:
        # Check against ignore patterns
        # Handle Obsidian metadata folders
        pass
```

**Enhanced Directory Processing:**
- Respect `.obsidianignore` files if present
- Skip `.obsidian/` configuration directories
- Handle Obsidian canvas files (`.canvas`)
- Process frontmatter metadata appropriately

**Multi-Vault Support:**
```python
# Support for multiple knowledge vaults
vaults = {
    "personal": VaultConfig("/home/user/PersonalVault"),
    "work": VaultConfig("/home/user/WorkVault"),
    "research": VaultConfig("/home/user/ResearchVault")
}
```

### User Experience
- **Setup**: Point to existing Obsidian vault, no file copying
- **Configuration**: Web UI for vault selection and settings
- **Compatibility**: Works alongside Obsidian without conflicts
- **Multi-Vault**: Switch between different knowledge bases

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Works with existing Obsidian vaults without modification
- ✅ Respects Obsidian ignore patterns and settings
- ✅ No conflicts with Obsidian file operations
- ✅ Support for 2+ vaults simultaneously

## Feature 3: Enhanced User Experience 🎨

### Problem Statement
Current interface lacks visual feedback about RAG operations and document relationships.

### Solution Design
**RAG-Aware Interface:**
- Visual indicators when RAG is active
- Show referenced documents in chat responses
- Search result enhancements with metadata
- Real-time sync status and statistics

### Technical Implementation

**Frontend Enhancements (`index.html`):**
```javascript
class RAGInterface {
    constructor() {
        this.syncStatus = new SyncStatusWidget();
        this.documentRefs = new DocumentReferenceTracker();
        this.searchEnhancer = new SearchResultEnhancer();
    }
    
    showDocumentReferences(chatResponse) {
        // Highlight which documents were used
        // Add clickable document references
        // Show relevance scores
    }
    
    updateSyncStatus(status) {
        // Show real-time sync operations
        // Display vault statistics
        // Indicate index freshness
    }
}
```

**Enhanced Chat Display:**
- **Document Pills**: Show referenced documents as clickable tags

**Hybrid Search System:**
- Combine keyword search (BM25) with semantic search (embeddings)
- Weighted scoring algorithm for optimal relevance
- Query expansion and synonym handling
- Document relationship analysis

### Technical Implementation

**Hybrid Search Engine:**
```python
class HybridSearch:
    def __init__(self, vector_store, keyword_index):
        self.vector_store = vector_store  # ChromaDB
        self.keyword_index = keyword_index  # BM25 or Whoosh
        self.weights = {"semantic": 0.7, "keyword": 0.3}
    
    def search(self, query: str, k: int = 5) -> List[SearchResult]:
        # 1. Semantic search via embeddings
        semantic_results = self.vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=k*2)
        
        # 2. Keyword search via BM25
        keyword_results = self.keyword_index.search(query, k=k*2)
        
        # 3. Combine and re-rank results
        return self._merge_and_rank(semantic_results, keyword_results)
    
    def _merge_and_rank(self, semantic, keyword):
        # Weighted combination of scores
        # De-duplication of overlapping results
        # Final ranking by combined relevance
        pass
```

**Query Intelligence:**
```python
class QueryProcessor:
    def expand_query(self, query: str) -> List[str]:
        # Generate related terms
        # Handle synonyms and variations
        # Technical term expansion (e.g., "restart" → ["restart", "reboot", "docker restart"])
        pass
    
    def classify_intent(self, query: str) -> QueryType:
        # Determine if query is: factual, procedural, conceptual
        # Adjust search strategy accordingly
        pass
```

**Document Relationships:**
```python
class DocumentGraph:
    def build_relationships(self, documents: List[Document]):
        # Analyze document similarity patterns
        # Extract cross-references and links
        # Build semantic relationship graph
        pass
    
    def find_related(self, document_id: str, k: int = 3) -> List[Document]:
        # Return semantically related documents
        # Consider content similarity and cross-references
        pass
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Filename Boosting**: Give extra weight to filename matches
- **Recency Weighting**: Prefer recently modified documents
